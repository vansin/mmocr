## Introduction

MMOCR is an open-source toolbox based on PyTorch and mmdetection for text detection, text recognition, and the corresponding downstream tasks including key information extraction. It is part of the [OpenMMLab](https://openmmlab.com/) project.

The main branch works with **PyTorch 1.6+**.

</div>

### Major Features

- **Comprehensive Pipeline**

  The toolbox supports not only text detection and text recognition, but also their downstream tasks such as key information extraction.

- **Multiple Models**

  The toolbox supports a wide variety of state-of-the-art models for text detection, text recognition and key information extraction.

- **Modular Design**

  The modular design of MMOCR enables users to define their own optimizers, data preprocessors, and model components such as backbones, necks and heads as well as losses. Please refer to [Overview](https://mmocr.readthedocs.io/en/dev-1.x/get_started/overview.html) for how to construct a customized model.

- **Numerous Utilities**

  The toolbox provides a comprehensive set of utilities which can help users assess the performance of models. It includes visualizers which allow visualization of images, ground truths as well as predicted bounding boxes, and a validation tool for evaluating checkpoints during training.  It also includes data converters to demonstrate how to convert your own data to the annotation files which the toolbox supports.

## Latest Updates

**The default branch has been switched to `1.x` from `main`, and we encourage
users to migrate to the latest version, though it comes with some cost. Please refer to [Migration Guide](https://mmocr.readthedocs.io/en/dev-1.x/migration/overview.html) for more
details.**

v1.0.0rc5 was released in 2023-01-06.

1. Two models, Aster and SVTR, are added to our model zoo. The full implementation of ABCNet is also available now.
2. Dataset Preparer supports 5 more datasets: CocoTextV2, FUNSD, TextOCR, NAF, SROIE.
3. We have 4 more text recognition transforms, and two more helper transforms.
4. The transform, `FixInvalidPolygon`, is getting smarter at dealing with invalid polygons, and now capable of handling more weird annotations. As a result, a complete training cycle on TotalText dataset can be performed bug-free. The weights of DBNet and FCENet pretrained on TotalText are also released.

Read [Changelog](https://mmocr.readthedocs.io/en/dev-1.x/notes/changelog.html) for more details!

## What's New in MMOCR 1.0

1. **New engines**. MMOCR 1.x is based on [MMEngine](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmengine), which provides a general and powerful runner that allows more flexible customizations and significantly simplifies the entrypoints of high-level interfaces.

2. **Unified interfaces**. As a part of the OpenMMLab 2.0 projects, MMOCR 1.x unifies and refactors the interfaces and internal logics of train, testing, datasets, models, evaluation, and visualization. All the OpenMMLab 2.0 projects share the same design in those interfaces and logics to allow the emergence of multi-task/modality algorithms.

3. **Cross project calling**. Benefiting from the unified design, you can use the models implemented in other OpenMMLab projects, such as MMDet. We provide an example of how to use MMDetection's Mask R-CNN through `MMDetWrapper`. Check our documents for more details. More wrappers will be released in the future.

4. **Stronger visualization**. We provide a series of useful tools which are mostly based on brand-new visualizers. As a result, it is more convenient for the users to explore the models and datasets now.

5. **More documentation and tutorials**. We add a bunch of documentation and tutorials to help users get started more smoothly. Read it [here](https://mmocr.readthedocs.io/en/dev-1.x/).

6. **One-stop Dataset Preparaion**. Multiple datasets are instantly ready with only one line of command, via our [Dataset Preparer](https://mmocr.readthedocs.io/en/dev-1.x/user_guides/data_prepare/dataset_preparer.html).

7. **Embracing more `projects/`**: We now introduce `projects/` folder, where some experimental features, frameworks and models can be placed, only needed to satisfy the minimum requirement on the code quality. Everyone is welcome to post their implementation of any great ideas in this folder! Learn more from our [example project](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmocr/blob/dev-1.x/projects/example_project/).

8. **More models**. MMOCR 1.0 supports more tasks and more state-of-the-art models!
